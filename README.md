# c-projects
Every projects that I've done will be uploaded to this repository.

1. First project is for Coursera, Princeton University, Algorithm Pt 1, first project, percolation. This course's main language is java,but I wrote with c++. It was implemented in union-find algorithm. It needs to get improved in terms of memory usage and time. Also, each nodes contain size of childs, however, only size of root node is correct. I didn't changed because it's not important for anything but root.
